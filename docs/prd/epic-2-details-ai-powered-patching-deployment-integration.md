# Epic 2 Details: AI-Powered Patching & Deployment Integration

- **Story 2.1: Integrate the AI/LLM Service**

  - **As a** developer, **I want** to integrate the agent with an AI/LLM service, **so that** it can be used for advanced, intelligent patching.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. The agent can successfully send a prompt to the configured LLM and receive a response.
    2. The LLM endpoint is configurable.

- **Story 2.2: Implement AI-Powered Patching for a Complex Rule**

  - **As a** developer, **I want** the agent to use the LLM to suggest patches for a complex issue that the rules engine cannot handle (e.g., adding specific Ingress annotations), **so that** we can validate the AI patching workflow.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. When a complex Ingress issue is detected, the agent sends a structured prompt to the LLM.
    2. The agent correctly processes the LLM's response and adds the suggested patch to the `patch.json` file.

- **Story 2.3: Build a Container Image for the Agent**

  - **As a** developer, **I want** to create a `Dockerfile` to package the agent into a container image, **so that** it can be run in any CI/CD pipeline.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. A `Dockerfile` exists in the repository.
    2. The `docker build` command successfully creates a runnable container image of the agent.

- **Story 2.4: Create a CI/CD Pipeline for Deployment**

  - **As a** developer, **I want** to create a basic CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions) that attempts to deploy the patched manifests to our test AKS cluster, **so that** the agent's full workflow can be triggered automatically.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. A GitHub Actions workflow file is configured in the repository.
    2. When triggered, the workflow builds the container and runs the deployment command against the test AKS cluster.

- **Story 2.5: Implement Final Status Notification**
  - **As a** developer, **I want** the agent's pipeline to send a final success or failure notification to Slack, **so that** users are informed of the outcome.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1. After the deployment step, a message is successfully posted to a configured Slack channel with the deployment status.

This section contains the official handoff prompts for the next agents in the workflow.

**Handoff to UX Expert**

- Since our MVP does not include a graphical user interface, no handoff to the UX Expert is needed at this time.

**Handoff to Architect**

> This Product Requirements Document (PRD), along with the `aks-copilot.pdf`, provides the complete functional requirements and vision for the project. Please create the **Architecture Document** based on these inputs.
>
> Pay close attention to the **Technical Assumptions** we've defined, including the serverless/event-driven approach and the requirement for a configurable system. The architecture should provide a detailed technical blueprint for the two epics defined for the MVP.
