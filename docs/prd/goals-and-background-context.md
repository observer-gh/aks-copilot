# Goals and Background Context

**Goals**

- Accelerate cloud migration project timelines.
- Reduce costs from manual errors and debugging.
- Create a standardized, repeatable migration process.

**Background Context**

- A key pain point for developers is that Kubernetes files working on a local machine often fail when deployed to Azure (AKS) due to incompatibilities. Existing tools find these errors but don't suggest the specific fixes needed for AKS, forcing a slow and manual debugging process.
