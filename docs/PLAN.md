alright, let’s lock this in as your final, detailed, encompassing plan for the project — consolidating all our back-and-forth.

📌 Project Plan – k3s → AKS Migration Copilot

1. Goal

Build an MCP-based AI Agent that inspects Kubernetes manifests from local k3s, detects AKS-specific incompatibilities, provides explanations with references (RAG), generates patch suggestions (LLM or deterministic), and (optionally) simulates apply + healthcheck.

👉 In short: lint → explain → patch → approve/apply → health summary.

⸻

2. Why This Matters
   • Pain point: Local manifests that work in k3s often fail in AKS (ingress, storage, RBAC, ACR auth).
   • Existing tools: kubectl --dry-run, kubeval, kube-score, Popeye = only validation. They don’t suggest fixes or AKS-specific guidance.
   • Differentiator: Prevents failures before deployment by combining rule-based checks, RAG “why”, and LLM patch generation.

3. Scope (MVP)

Focus on 6–8 AKS-specific rules (plain YAML only, no Helm/Kustomize in v0). 1. IngressClass: change nginx → azure/application-gateway; add AGIC annotations (ssl-redirect, probes). 2. Service Exposure: heuristics (API/web → Ingress; DB/internal → ClusterIP). 3. StorageClass: map local-path → managed-csi; show mock SC list. 4. ImagePullSecrets / ACR: require <acr>.azurecr.io; prompt user for ACR host; generate pull secret patch. 5. Requests/Limits: if missing, suggest defaults (cpu 100m/200m; mem 128Mi/256Mi) with RAG justification. 6. Node Scheduling: warn on taints/labels mismatch; suggest AKS pool labels. 7. Probes: add readiness/liveness if absent. 8. Optional: DNS/CSI flags legacy warnings.

4. Architecture & Components

MCP Tools
• k8s.inspect(manifests) → violation objects.
• k8s.explain(violation) → RAG note + source link.
• k8s.patch.suggest(manifest, violation) → deterministic or LLM JSON Patch.
• k8s.apply(patch) → mock apply.
• k8s.health(ns) → mock events/top summary.

Orchestration Flow

manifests → inspect
for each violation:
why = explain(v) # RAG
if simple: patch = deterministic
else: patch = LLM (guardrails)
show violations+patches → user approves
apply (mock) → health summary

Guardrails for LLM
• System prompt: “You are a Kubernetes expert. Output ONLY valid JSON Patch array.”
• Few-shot examples.
• Validation: JSON schema → path existence → dry-apply → retry (2x).
• Fallback: mark violation “manual” if still invalid.
• Log all prompts/outputs for debugging.

RAG
• Curated “golden docs”: 1 markdown per rule (≤500 words).
• Chunking: 120–180 tokens, semantically complete.
• Embeddings: Gemini API.
• Vector store: FAISS (in-memory).
• Retrieval: top-2 chunks; always show source.

State
• Session vars: {acrHost, defaultSC, namespace, retries}.
• Stored in memory (st.session_state or CLI context).

5. User Experience

CLI (must-have)
• copilot fix ./manifests --target aks --acr myacr.azurecr.io
• Outputs:
• report.md (violations, why, suggested patches)
• patch.json (JSON Patch)
• health.json (mock summary)

Streamlit UI (bonus, Day 3 if time)
• File uploader (manifests folder).
• Violations table with expanders (why + diff).
• Approve buttons → patch queue.
• Apply (mock) → health summary.

⸻

6. Tech Stack
   • Core: Python
   • YAML parsing: pyyaml
   • CLI: typer
   • HTTP (LLM/RAG): httpx
   • RAG: Gemini embeddings + FAISS vector store
   • UI: Streamlit (optional)
   • Containerization: Dockerfile → ACR → Azure App Service for Containers

⸻

8. Testing Strategy
   • Unit tests: one fixture per rule → assert correct violation detected.
   • Patch golden set: 10–15 manifests → compare patch structure.
   • RAG eval: sample Qs per rule → check retrieval relevance.
   • E2E tests: 3 sample apps (web, db, batch) → expect ≥80% auto-patchable.

⸻

9. Deliverables
   • CLI tool (copilot)
   • MCP server (FastAPI backend for tools)
   • RAG KB (markdown files)
   • Sample manifests, report.md, patch.json, health.json
   • Optional Streamlit UI
   • Docker image (ACR)

⸻

✅ This covers feasibility, usefulness, architecture, UX, tech stack, timeline, risks, and deliverables.
It’s lean enough for 3 days, but with a strong AI Agent angle (RAG + LLM patching).

Would you like me to also prepare a 5-slide deck outline (Why → What → How → Demo → Next) so you’re ready for reviews?
